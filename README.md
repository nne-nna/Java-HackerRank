# Java HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains my **daily solutions to HackerRank Java problems**, solved locally using **VS Code** and pushed consistently to GitHub.

## Purpose
- Improve my Java fundamentals through daily practice
- Build problem-solving consistency
- Maintain a public track record of my progress

## How I Work
- Problems are solved locally in my IDE
- Each solution is compiled and run from the terminal
- Code is organized gradually by topic as I progress

## Running the Code
Most programs can be compiled and run using:

```bash
javac src/<package>/<ClassName>.java
java -cp src <package>.<ClassName>
```
📌 This repository evolves daily as I solve new problems and refine my structure.
